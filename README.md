# Visualize audio transformations with streamlit
A streamlit application that lets you explore the effect of different audio augmentation techniques. Uses [audiomentations](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations) to implement the augmentations.

You upload a (wave) audio file, select different augmentations to apply, and examine the results:
