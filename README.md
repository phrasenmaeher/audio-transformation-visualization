# Visualize audio transformations with streamlit
A streamlit application that lets you explore the effect of different audio augmentation techniques. Uses [audiomentations](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations) to implement the augmentations.

You can select various techniques in the sidebar, upload you file, and listen (and see!) to the result:
